 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It is a crucial factor in determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory or storage an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input data. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize space usage while solving problems. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size.
